			<h4><b>Ordering</b></h4>
			<p> 
			Whilst all efforts are made to ensure accuracy of product descriptions, specifications and pricing there may be occasions where errors arise. Should such a situation occur <a href="../index.html">AND.com</a> cannot accept your order. In the event of a mistake you will be contacted with a full explanation and a corrected offer. The information displayed is considered as an invitation not as a confirmed offer for sale. The contract is confirmed upon supply of goods.
			</p>

			<p>
			Given the popularity and/or supply constraints of some of our products, <a href="../index.html">AND.com</a> may have to limit the number of products available for purchase. <a href="../index.html">AND.com</a> reserves the right to change quantities available for purchase at any time, even after you place an order.
			</p>

			<p>
			Both parties agree that, following order dispatch, transportation is the sole responsibility of the third-party logistics company. During this stage, full ownership of the product(s) belongs to the buyer; all associated liability and risks during transportation shall be borne by the buyer.
			</p>

			<h4><b>Shipping and Delivery</b></h4>

			<p>Shipping times displayed on <a href="../index.html">AND.com</a> refer to the estimated time it takes for packages to leave our hands. Since the actual delivery of your order can be impacted by many events beyond <a href="../index.html"><a href="../index.html">AND.com</a></a> control once it leaves our facilities, we suggest that if customers have a special occasion or event that they wish to use their item for, such as a birthday, that they order their items well in advance. <a href="../index.html"><a href="../index.html">AND.com</a></a> cannot be held liable for late deliveries. We will, however, work with you to ensure a smooth shopping experience.</p>

			<p>For a smooth delivery and peace of mind, we strongly recommend that customers purchase shipping insurance during the checkout.In the event that your package has a shipping issue, <a href="../index.html"><a href="../index.html">AND.com</a></a> will send you a replacement package free of charge. If the item is no longer in stock, we will offer you a refund option.</p>

			<p>Any orders that do not have shipping insurance will not be the responsibility of <a href="../index.html"><a href="../index.html">AND.com</a></a> and the customer takes full liability for their package during the shipping process.</p>

			<p>There may be occasions when <a href="../index.html"><a href="../index.html">AND.com</a></a> confirms your order but subsequently learns that it cannot supply the ordered product. In the event we cannot supply a product you ordered in a timely fashion, <a href="../index.html">AND.com</a> will contact customers and offer to cancel the order and refund the purchase cost in full.
			</p>
			<p>
			We try to make the delivery process as simple as possible and we are able to send your order either to you home or to your work place. We can ship to PO Boxes via all shipping methods, except for expedited shipping methods, as signatures are required upon delivery. Express shipments of this type can only be delivered to physical addresses.
